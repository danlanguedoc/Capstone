[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/danlanguedoc/Capstone.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/danlanguedoc/Capstone)


# Capstone

The Capstone package provides the user with visualization tools that use `ggplot2` and `leaflet` to analyze NOAA earthquake data (https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/form?t=101650&s=1&d=1) 

The package provides basic data cleaning functionality as well as two types of visualizations, timelines and maps.

## Example

This first example will generate a time line of earthquake events with location labels.  The magnitude and number of deaths are represented by the size of the data markers and their color

```r
filename <- system.file("inst/extdata/signif.txt", package = "Capstone")"
eq_raw <- readr::read_delim(filename, delim = "\t")
eq_clean <- eq_clean_data(eq_raw)
  eq_clean %>% filter(COUNTRY %in% c("GREECE", "ITALY"), YEAR > 2000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = DATE,
             y = COUNTRY,
             color = as.numeric(TOTAL_DEATHS),
             size = as.numeric(EQ_PRIMARY)
  )) +
  geom_timeline() +
  geom_timeline_label(aes(label = LOCATION_NAME), maxCountries = 5) +
  theme_timeline() +
  labs(title = "Earthquake Fatalities", color = "# deaths", size = "Richter scale value") +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "black", high = "red")

```


The next example demonstrates how to plot geographical data for the earthquake events

```r
filename <- system.file("inst/extdata/signif.txt", package = "Capstone")"
eq_raw <- readr::read_delim(filename, delim = "\t")
eq_clean <- eq_clean_data(eq_raw)
eq_Mexico <- dplyr::filter(eq_clean,COUNTRY == "MEXICO" & lubridate::year(DATE) >2000) %>%
   dplyr::mutate(popup_text = eq_create_label(.))
```
